## Dectree

[![Build](https://github.com/clementwanjau/dectree-rs/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/clementwanjau/dectree-rs/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A byte and mask based decision engine for creating byte
sequences (and potential comparison masks) for general purpose
signature matching implemented in pure rust.

The decision tree uses a lot of RAM but is very fast.
